Title: OpenXTalk.org General Music Library

Version: 1.0.0

Author: OpenXTalk.org

Description:
The General Music script library contains handlers for various musicality
related tasks. Currently this incorporates a slightly modified version of UDI's
makeSMF library for creating MIDI data from xTalk 'ABC' style text music notation,
handlers for reading patch information from SoundFont2 and Douwnloadable Sounds
files (.sf2 / .dls), handlers for coverting MIDI numeric values to and from
human readable names (for example a MIDI note number to/from an
actual note name/octave), functions for reading and  writing MIDI files to and from
human readable timestampled event lists, handlers for converting time measurements
(such as Beats Per Minute to Milliseconds), and more!

The plan is to add a few more soon as well, such as incorporate music related
SVG-Icon family which would include icons such as note-duration symbols
for use in creating GUIs for musical stacks.
The intention is that this library will grow to include many
more useful music and sound composition related scripts.

Name: playPMD_AVMIDIPlayer

Type: command

Syntax: playPMD_AVMIDIPlayer pPlaySentenceMusicalData, pTempoBPM,[pProgramNumber,[<pSoundBankFile>]

Summary:
plays the Playsentence Musical Data (PMD) starting at the specified beats per minute,
with the given sound patch number using Apple's AVMIDIPlayer API.

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac,ios

Platforms: desktop,mobile

Parameters:

pPlaySentenceMusicalData: string containing extended-HyperTalk / xTalk 'ABC' textual music notation.

pTempoBPM: Intitial playback tenmpo in Beats Per Minute, this may be overridden

pProgramNumber:
number in range 0-127 is the sound patch to use as the initial
or default instrument sound. This nay be overridden by patchchange messages within
the playSentence string.

pSoundBankFile: An optional filePath to a soundBank (.sf2 or .dls) file to use for playback.

Example: playPMD_AVMIDIPlayer ("C4q Ee. Gs..",120,1)

Description:
Attempts to play the Playsentence Music Data (PMD), optionally starting at the specified tempo
in beats per minute, optionally with a given MIDI patch number (need to add 'bank-patch' suport),
with the optionally provided Soubdbank (.sf2 or .dls) file. The default values are 120(BPM)
and sound patch 1 (GM "Piano 1"),loading the first SoundBankFile found in default locations.
On macOS this should load the default Roland GS Soundbank, a small Soundbank
from the 1990s that came with QuickTime v2.5+, on iOS no default soundbank is provided
by the OS and so one must be provided.
PLEASE NOTE that this command will do nothing (fail silently) if the AVMIDIPLayer
builder extension is not loaded therefore scripts should check for the presence of
the AVMIDIPLayer libray before calling this command directly, or use the platform aware
version, PlayPMD which should try to use the best musical playback engine currenlty availble.
