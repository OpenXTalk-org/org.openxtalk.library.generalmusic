 -- Extended note --

Octave
   can use octave -1 and 0 (zero) for the full MIDI pitch range

Accidental mark
  ## Double sharp
    ex. G## This note is same to A
  bb Double flat
    ex. Abb This note is same to G
  _ Flat ( same to b )
    ex A_ This note is equal to Ab
  __ Double flat ( same to bb )
    ex A__ This note is equal to Abb
  ^ Natural
    ex G^ This note ignores a Alternate command.

Extended note value (length)
   max 8 dotted.
      Cq. = q + q/2   Cq.. = q + q/2 + q/4   Cq... = q + q/2 + q/4 + q/8
   any devided beat note.
      Cq/5   Cq/7  ets.
   length addition.
      Cwe = w + e    Cwq3 = w + q3

 @ gate time
   percentage sound of note.
      Cq@5 = q/2 sound  and q/2 silent.
   range 0-20   initially 10
   If not specify gate time then hand over from prev note.

 V velocity
   velocity( volume ) of note.
      CqV5 = 1/2 volume
   range 0-10   initially 10
   If not specify velocity then hand over from prev note.

 (  ) chord
   max 32 notes sound at a time on each parts.
      (C E G)q ... C & E & G sound q time.
      (C4 E G C5)h ... C & E & G & C5 sound h time.
   each notes are able to have those length.
      (C E Ge)q ... C & E sound q time. But G sound e time.
   each notes are able to have gate time & velocity too.
      (C E G@7V5) ... only G, gate time 7 and velocity 5.
   those length, gate time and velocity effect only that note.
      dont hand over to next note.

 A note is ...
   note name + octabe + length + gate time + velocity
   ex. (C#4qe.@10V10)qe.@10V10

 -- alternate & key sift command --

Alternate
  # Sharp displacement command
    ex. #CF  C is C#, F is F# after the command
  ## Double sharp displacement command.
    ex. ##F  F is G after the command
  _ Flat displacement command
    ex. _BE  B is Bb, E is Eb after the command
  __ Double flat displacement command.
    ex. _B  B is A after the command
  ^ Natural displacement command ( Cancel alternate )
    ex. ^B  B is B after the command
    If pitch name is omitted then all pitch is changed to natural.
    You can join # or _ just after that.
    ex. ^#F  all pitch is to natural, and displacement F to F#.
  Those does not influence a note of numerical value expression. ( 60q as Cq )
  Accidental sticking to a note is given priority to.


key shift
  ~n ex ~12  All note after the command is up to12 half pitch.
       ex ~-12 All note after the command is down to12 half pitch 
       ex ~ (parameter is omitted)  All note after the command is changed to origin.
